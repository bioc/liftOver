Description: The liftOver facilities developed in conjunction with the UCSC
    browser track infrastructure are available for transforming
    data in GRanges formats.  This is illustrated here with
    an image of the EBI/NHGRI GWAS catalog that is, as of May 10 2017,
    distributed with coordinates defined by NCBI build hg38.
Depends: R (>= 3.3.0),
